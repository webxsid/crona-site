## Multi-Device Sync

This document is about future sync architecture only.

Current local architecture:
- the local daemon is a Go background process
- local clients talk to it over a Unix socket
- this document does not change that local IPC model

Future sync is a separate concern layered on top of the local daemon.

### Problem

Crona is local-first with a SQLite database per device. Multiple devices create divergent state. Direct DB sync isn't viable because SQLite files are not merge-friendly, and there is no natural conflict resolution at the row level.

### Why Op Logs Are The Right Foundation

Every mutation in Crona already produces an immutable `Op` record:

```text
{ id, user_id, device_id, entity, entity_id, action, payload, timestamp }
```

The op log is append-only, ordered by timestamp, and tagged by device. Syncing Crona across devices reduces to sharing the op log, replaying it on each device, and deriving consistent state.

The model is structurally similar to how distributed databases, CRDTs, and event-sourced systems handle sync. No central authority is required.

### Proposed Solution: Layered Sync

Three sync modes, each building on the previous:

#### Layer 1: File-Based Sync

Export the op log as an append-only NDJSON file to a shared folder watched by any cloud sync provider:

```text
~/<cloud-provider>/crona-sync/
  ops-<device-id>.ndjson
  ops-<device-id-2>.ndjson
```

On startup and periodically, each device:
1. reads all `ops-*.ndjson` files from other devices
2. filters ops it has not seen yet
3. replays them against the local DB in timestamp order
4. appends its own new ops to `ops-<its-device-id>.ndjson`

Works with iCloud Drive, Dropbox, Google Drive, Syncthing, or any folder-sync tool.

#### Layer 2: Self-Hosted Sync Relay

A lightweight relay server that acts as a dumb op store:

```text
POST /ops
GET  /ops?since=
```

Devices push their ops on mutation and pull on startup or reconnect.

#### Layer 3: Local Network P2P

When devices are on the same network, sync directly without a relay:

- kernel advertises itself via mDNS
- devices discover peers
- peers exchange ops directly

### Conflict Resolution

Since ops are immutable and timestamped, conflicts are resolved deterministically:

| Entity | Strategy | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repo / Stream / Issue fields | Last-write-wins by `timestamp` | Simple fields, low conflict risk |
| Issue status transitions | Ordered by timestamp | State-machine style updates |
| Active context | Per device, never merged | Context is device-local |
| Sessions | Device-scoped, no merge needed | Sessions are owned by one device |
| Deletes | Soft-delete wins | `deleted_at` is terminal |

### What Does Not Sync

- active context
- timer state
- auth tokens

### Implementation Notes

- Op replay must be idempotent.
- Minor clock skew is acceptable for last-write-wins.
- The local DB remains derivable from the op log.
- Every mutation must produce an op.
