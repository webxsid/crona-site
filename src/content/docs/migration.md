description: "Switch Crona install methods or release channels."
order: 2.1

Use this guide when switching Crona install methods or release channels.
It covers moves between Homebrew, Scoop, the legacy install script, and the `crona-beta`/stable channels.

Estimated time: 20-30 minutes, depending on how much old state needs to be backed up and cleaned up.

The migration flow is:
stop Crona, back up the database, clear the old runtime, remove the old binaries, install the new target, and restore the saved backup.
Use the destination-specific guides below for exact commands on Homebrew, Go source installs, or Scoop.
If you are moving from a legacy install script, run the latest beta installer once before switching package managers.

The detailed guides live here:

- [Legacy to Homebrew](migration/legacy-to-brew.md)
- [Legacy to Go](migration/legacy-to-go.md)
- [Legacy to Scoop](migration/legacy-to-scoop.md)

Shared migration flow:

1. Stop every running Crona process.
2. Download the latest beta release installer script from GitHub Releases.
3. Make the installer executable and run it, then choose to overwrite the existing install.
4. Run `crona backup`.
5. Remove the runtime directory.
6. Remove the installed binaries.
7. Install the destination package manager version.
8. Run `crona restore <path-to-backup>`.

If you are not sure which destination to choose, start with the package manager you want to keep long term:

- Homebrew on macOS and Linux
- Go source installs when you want to keep using `go install`
- Scoop on Windows
