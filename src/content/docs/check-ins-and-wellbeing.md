Crona includes a local wellbeing reflection loop that tracks daily self-reported health signals alongside task execution statistics to help you monitor workload sustainability.

## Daily Check-Ins

A check-in is a daily self-report entry containing:
- **Mood**: Rating from `1` to `5`.
- **Energy**: Rating from `1` to `5`.
- **Sleep**: Total sleep hours and an optional sleep quality score.
- **Screen Time**: Optional tracking of daily computer screen time.
- **Notes**: Narrative logging for context on the day's performance.

To trigger the check-in dialog in either the **Daily** or **Wellbeing** views, press `w`.

## The Wellbeing Dashboard

The Wellbeing dashboard splits data display into two primary panes:
1. **Metrics Window**: A 7-day rolling window showing trends in mood, energy, sleep hours, screen time, focus duration, and habit completions.
2. **Momentum Pane**: A pane displaying custom habit and context streaks, current versus best streak scores, and completion milestones. On wide terminals, this pane becomes independently scrollable.

## Burnout & Recovery Signals

Crona calculates burnout indicators using a localized heuristics engine. It processes:
- **Focus vs. Rest Ratio**: Compares active focus session durations against scheduled breaks and rest days.
- **Velocity Trends**: Evaluates issue completion volume over a rolling 7-day period.
- **Self-Reported Health**: Correlates mood and energy scores against work volumes.
- **Planning Accountability**: Tracks the ratio of completed plans to overdue, rolled-over, or abandoned issues.

These signals are computed locally and visualized on the Wellbeing dashboard as trend indicators, helping you notice when workload patterns become unsustainable.

## Local & Private Storage

All check-in notes, ratings, and metrics are written directly to your local SQLite database. None of this data is sent to external services, maintaining complete privacy for your health and work logs.
