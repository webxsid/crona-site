Crona's Terminal User Interface is keyboard-driven and context-aware. Use the footer of each pane for active key guides.

## Global Bindings

These shortcuts remain active across most standard views:

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `v` | Open the view selection jump menu |
| `[` / `]` | Cycle through views (restricted when timer is active) |
| `tab` / `shift+tab` | Cycle pane focus in the active view |
| `up` / `down` | Navigate the current selection up / down |
| `?` | Toggle help overlay modal |
| `ctrl+c` | Quit TUI |
| `K` | Request local daemon shutdown |

After opening view jump with `v`, press a view mnemonic directly. For example, `g` opens **Summary** and `y` opens **History**. Use the arrow keys and `enter` to choose from the menu instead.
