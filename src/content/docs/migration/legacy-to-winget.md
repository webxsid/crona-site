description: Move a legacy Crona install to Winget on Windows while preserving your database backup.
order: 2.4
---

Use this guide when you are moving off the legacy install script and want to keep Crona managed by Winget on Windows.

## Before You Start

Stop every running Crona process before you touch the install.

Close any open TUI windows, CLI sessions, and background Crona processes. If a process is still running after you close the app, stop it manually with Task Manager or `Stop-Process`.

## 1. Download The Latest Beta Installer

Open the latest beta release page on GitHub Releases and download the legacy installer script for Windows.

Download `install-crona-tui.ps1` from the release assets.

## 2. Run The Legacy Installer Once

Run the script and allow it to replace the existing install when prompted.

```powershell
$version = "<version>"
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/webxsid/crona/releases/download/$version/install-crona-tui.ps1" -OutFile "$env:TEMP\install-crona-tui.ps1"
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:TEMP\install-crona-tui.ps1"
```

Keep the existing install selected when the script asks whether to overwrite the current version.

## 3. Back Up Your Database

Run:

```powershell
crona backup
```

The command prints the backup path. Keep that path for the restore step.

## 4. Remove The Runtime Directory

Remove the Crona runtime directory after the backup is complete.

- Windows prod: `%LocalAppData%\Crona`
- Windows dev: `%LocalAppData%\Crona Dev`

## 5. Remove The Legacy Binaries

Remove the old binaries from the Winget user install directory if they are still present.

Typical location:

- `%LocalAppData%\Programs\Crona\bin`

## 6. Install Winget

Install the package manager version you want to keep:

```powershell
winget install --id Webxsid.Crona -e
```

## 7. Restore The Backup

Run:

```powershell
crona restore <path-to-backup>
```

If the runtime directory already contains a `crona.db`, Crona prompts before overwriting it.

## After Migration

- Winget owns install, update, and uninstall.
- Updates use `winget upgrade --id Webxsid.Crona -e`.
- `crona backup` and `crona restore` only move `crona.db`.
