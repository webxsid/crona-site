description: "Move a legacy Crona install to Homebrew on macOS or Linux."
order: 2.2
---

Use this guide when you are moving off the legacy install script and want to keep Crona on Homebrew afterward.
Use `crona-beta` instead of `crona` if you want to stay on the beta track.

Estimated time: 15-20 minutes, plus any extra time needed to finish backup and restore on a large dataset.

Stop Crona, run the beta installer once, back up the database, clear the old runtime, remove the old binaries, and switch to Homebrew.
If you are moving between stable and beta Homebrew tracks, only the install command changes.

## Before You Start

Stop every running Crona process before you touch the install.

Close any open TUI windows, CLI sessions, and background Crona processes. If a process is still running after you close the app, stop it manually with your operating system tools.

## 1. Download The Latest Beta Installer

Download the legacy installer script for your platform from the latest beta release page on GitHub Releases.

- macOS and Linux: `install-crona-tui.sh`
- Windows: `install-crona-tui.ps1`

## 2. Run The Legacy Installer Once

Make the script executable, run it, and allow it to replace the existing install when prompted.

```bash
chmod +x install-crona-tui.sh
./install-crona-tui.sh
```

Keep the existing install selected when the script asks whether to overwrite the current version.

## 3. Back Up Your Database

Run:

```bash
crona backup
```

The command prints the backup path. Keep that path for the restore step.

## 4. Remove The Runtime Directory

Remove the Crona runtime directory after the backup is complete.

- macOS prod: `~/Library/Application Support/Crona`
- macOS dev: `~/Library/Application Support/Crona Dev`
- Linux prod: `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/crona`
- Linux dev: `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/crona-dev`

If you only use the production install, the prod path is the one to remove.

## 5. Remove The Legacy Binaries

Remove the old binaries from your `PATH`.

Typical locations:

- `~/.local/bin/crona`
- `~/.local/bin/crona-daemon`
- `~/.local/bin/crona-tui`

If you installed somewhere else, remove those copies too.

## 6. Install Homebrew

Install the package manager version you want to keep:

```bash
brew tap webxsid/tap
brew install crona
```

For the beta track, use:

```bash
brew install crona-beta
```

## 7. Restore The Backup

Run:

```bash
crona restore <path-to-backup>
```

If the runtime directory already contains a `crona.db`, Crona prompts before overwriting it.

## After Migration

- Homebrew now owns install, update, and uninstall.
- Stable updates use `brew upgrade crona`.
- Beta updates use `brew upgrade crona-beta`.
- `crona backup` and `crona restore` only move `crona.db`.
