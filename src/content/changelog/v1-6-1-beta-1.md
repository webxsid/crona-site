Crona v1.6.1-beta.1 expands the Wellbeing and habit surfaces with richer Momentum detail, context-aware streak targets, and a more expressive habit streak editor. It also standardizes the calendar shortcut story on `ctrl+e`/`ctrl+y` across the TUI.

## Added
- Momentum detail now shows the current bucket, the contributor list, and the target names behind each streak.
- Habit streak definitions can now target either habits or workflow contexts, with `any`/`all` matching and validation that matches the selected target type.
- The momentum surface now presents the expanded target model in the card layout and timeline rendering.

## Changed
- Habit streak creation and editing now use a multi-step target/detail/review flow instead of the older habit-only path.
- Calendar and date-picker prompts now standardize on `ctrl+e` and `ctrl+y`.
- Dev seed data and tests now cover the expanded momentum model and the richer habit validation paths.
- The docs and release language now consistently call the local background process the daemon.

## Fixed
- The shared API contract now exposes `momentum.detail` alongside the other momentum methods used by the TUI.
- The momentum and habit UI now align with the normalized target kinds, match modes, and contributor labels used by the kernel.
