Crona v1.6.1-beta.2 tightens the narrow-screen experience across the daily view. The daily issue pane now falls back to a compact list layout on smaller widths, and pane action hints shorten themselves before they wrap into multi-line noise.

## Changed
- The daily issue pane now switches to a compact list layout on narrow screens so context, effort, and status remain readable.
- Pane action hints now shorten their labels on small screens instead of wrapping into two or three lines.
- The daily dashboard calendar and hint regions now stay stable when navigating narrow layouts and paging backward through dates.

## Fixed
- Narrow daily layouts no longer let the hint line balloon into stacked multi-line text.
- The daily dashboard no longer repeats top-level UI lines when stepping backward through dates on smaller screens.
