Crona v1.6.0-beta.3 trims dead code from the release/update path, removes obsolete local-update scaffolding, and fixes GitHub release publication so the public release body is sourced from `docs/release-notes/<tag>.md`.

## Added
- GitHub release bodies now come from the matching file in `docs/release-notes`.

## Changed
- The update surface now keeps only the supported status, refresh, and diagnostics actions.
- The release workflow now overwrites the GitHub release body from the public release-notes file after GoReleaser publishes the assets.
- The release metadata checks still require the matching release-notes file, and now the publish path uses the same source.

## Fixed
- Public release notes are no longer pulled from git changelog history when a `docs/release-notes/<tag>.md` file exists.
- The release/update code no longer carries dormant local-update and dismiss flows that were not part of the supported user experience.
