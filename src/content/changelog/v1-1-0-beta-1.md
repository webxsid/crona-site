Crona v1.1.0-beta.1 rolls up the early post-`1.0.2` improvements that were ready for broader validation.

## Added
- Configurable date display formats for the TUI and Crona-generated reports.
- Prompt glyph modes for dialogs, with `emoji`, `unicode`, and `ascii` options.
- A Daily calendar summary surface that appears when there is enough terminal width.

## Changed
- Daily summary progress bars use more of the available wide-screen space.
- Human-facing report dates follow the selected display format.
- Accountability numbers are rounded for readability.

## Fixed
- Due-date calendar shortcuts now work reliably across terminals.
- Daily reporting no longer counts resolved or abandoned delayed work as active risk.
- Prompt glyph settings respond correctly in the Settings view.
