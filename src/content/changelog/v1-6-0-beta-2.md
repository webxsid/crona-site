Crona v1.6.0-beta.2 sharpens the distribution story across the app and docs. This beta adds first-class migration commands, extends managed-install support to Windows winget users, and makes the install-script deprecation path visible and actionable before the `1.6.x` line moves fully to managed installers.

## Added
- `crona backup` now creates a portable copy of `crona.db` and prints the backup path for safekeeping.
- `crona restore <path>` now restores a saved `crona.db` after you reinstall Crona with the method you want to keep.
- Winget is now a first-class managed install path on Windows, with source-aware update guidance in the UI and CLI.
- The Updates view now highlights the install-script deprecation and points users to the migration guide.
- A dedicated migration guide now walks through backup, uninstall, reinstall, and restore for package-manager switches and beta/stable channel changes.

## Changed
- The install guide now leads with Homebrew on macOS and Linux, winget on Windows, and treats GitHub install scripts as legacy fallback paths.
- Homebrew stable and beta installs now map to separate formulas with channel-aware update commands and migration guidance.
- The Updates view now reads as a decision screen instead of a debug dump, with migration actions surfaced prominently.
- Release and distribution docs now direct users to the migration guide whenever they need to switch install methods or channels.

## Fixed
- Script installs no longer read as the preferred path in docs or the update surface.
- Migration guidance now clearly tells users to back up `crona.db` before uninstalling and reinstalling Crona with a new installer.
